##Predicting Bike-Sharing Data (Your First Neural Network) 

In this project, I got to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, to have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation, and other concepts that are important to know before I move to higher-level tools such as PyTorch. I saw how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!
